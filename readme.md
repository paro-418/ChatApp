have follow these steps:

## steps

1. fork or download this project to your pc
2. move to the client folder & install dependencies
3. move to the server folder & install dependencies
4. make a variable **PORT** inside .env file and assign it a value. **eg PORT = 5000**
5. make a variable **MONGO_URL** and assign it the url of your data base
   **MONGO_URL='mongodb+srv://USER:PASSWORD@CLUSTER_NAME.xowvhp7.mongodb.net/DATABASE_NAME?retryWrites=true&w=majority'**
6. finally start both client & server folder server
